#ToggleJS

Note: Thanks to the creation of CSS3 transitions, there are alternatives like [css-toggle-switch](https://github.com/ghinda/css-toggle-switch) which may be better for simple toggles.

CSS based toggle switches don't have the ability to be dragged (right now) and sometimes require extra markup. However, they work very well for most projects and don't rely on JS/jQuery.

----------------

ToggleJS is a jQuery plug-in that replaces checkboxes or radio switches with toggle switches similar to those used by the iPhone. It is based on iButton by Giva Labs, however has rewritten CSS to LESS, and no longer requires any images. View example page at http://slang800.github.com/toggleJS/
