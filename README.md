#ToggleJS

Note: this project is deprecated and won't be developed anymore. Thanks to the creation of CSS3 transitions, there are much better alternatives like [css-toggle-switch](https://github.com/ghinda/css-toggle-switch)

ToggleJS is a jQuery plug-in that replaces checkboxes or radio switches with toggle switches similar to those used by the iPhone. It is based on iButton by Giva Labs, however has rewritten CSS to LESS, and no longer requires any images. View example page at http://slang800.github.com/toggleJS/
